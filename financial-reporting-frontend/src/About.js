        Personal Interests: I have a love of music and enjoy playing the guitar in my free time. Additionally, I am an avid hockey fan and enjoy playing the sport whenever I get the chance. Traveling is another passion of mine; I recently had an amazing trip to Ireland, which allowed me to explore a new culture and technologies.
